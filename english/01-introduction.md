## Introduction

The “Security Center” software is designed to run under control of Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7 operations systems. The server part of the “Security Center” software is recommended to run under control of Microsoft Windows Server 2003/2008 operational systems. It is necessary to note the following features of the "Security Center" software:

* It consists of independent functional parts (modules) each one of which is designed to fulfill specific task. This on the one hand, permits to protect each module against possible failure of any other to the utmost level and, on the other hand, allows each module to be installed in a separate computer in a network.
* It is oriented to work in a network which supports TCP/IP protocol. Thus any changes made in the system on any network computer are immediately applied to all software modules working in this network. 
* Operator rights are determined in relation to particular action in specific software module. Thus, the levels of operator access to both entire program and its separate components are implemented. For example, operator access both to entire Object Manager module and to the function of object security schedule editing only can be limited.

Receiving equipment of a central station makes possible to pick up and process events from control panels (hubs, object blocks) having built-in communicators (digital message transfer units – specialized modems). Depending on the control panel type, its functional and service capabilities, particular information about object status can be received from this panel. Most of control panels can transmit wide range of information. For example, these can be user data who performed arming or disarming; place (zone number) of alarm or failure (open or short-circuit); partial arming with indication of disarmed zones, etc. Due to this a feature duty operator of the complex has the most comprehensive information both about object status (armed, disarmed, alarm, etc.) and about equipment technical condition (battery discharged, missing 220V, telephone line failure, etc.)
